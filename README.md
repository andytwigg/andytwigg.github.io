# about me

I'm a computer scientist with expertise in data processing and machine learning. I'm currently at Google, working on the AI data team. Previously, I worked on ML and large-scale data processing at Lacework, a cloud security company trying to use large data and ML to solve security challenges with lots of log data and things like inductive graph embeddings and anomaly detection (Lacework was acquired by Fortinet in 2024). Previously, I was founder/CTO of Acunu, a big data startup (acquired) and C9 (ML for sales, acquired by Insidesales.com). Before that, I was a Fellow in Computer Science at Oxford University and received my PhD from Cambridge University on approximate routing in graphs with failures.
