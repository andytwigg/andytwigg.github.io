# about me

I'm a computer scientist specializing in big data and machine learning. I've been founder/CTO of 2 startups in the big data/ML space, both acquired -- Acunu was acquired by a big tech company, and C9 was acquired by Insidesales.com). I did my PhD in graph algorithms at [Cambridge University](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) in 2006, and I was a Fellow in Computer Science at [St Johns College, Oxford](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/) from 2008-13.

I'm currently leading ML efforts at [lacework](http://www.lacework.com), a cloud security startup. We collect billions of messages per hour from machines and logs, and use a variety of techniques including self-supervised graph representation learning and anomaly detection.



# experience

### 2020-present Distinguished Engineer, Lacework
I work on ML and large-scale data processing efforts at Lacework, a cloud security startup trying to treat cloud security as a big data problem. We collect billions of messages per hour from agents and cloud data sources, and use a variety of techniques including unsupervised graph representation learning and anomaly detection. We raised ~$1.9B with a valuation of over ~$8B.

### 2018-2020 Entrepreneur in residence, Milliways/Rocketship.vc
I was an EIR, exploring ideas around deep RL. One project was to use RL to [learn how to trade](https://medium.com/@andytwigg/learning-to-trade-with-deep-rl-666ed6bbd921
) with L3 data. We build a full simulator on L3 data with several TBs from a large crypto exchange. This enabled us to do per-tick book reconstruction for better queue length estimation, etc.

### 2014-17 Chief Scientist, Insidesales.com and CTO, C9 (acquired by Insidesales.com)
I was CTO at C9, we were one of the first companies to apply deep ML to problems in sales data, including forecasting and opportunity scoring. [Acquired by Insidesales.com](https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2015/05/28/insidesales-com-acquires-c9-in-predictive-analytics-battle/), where I was Chief Scientist until 2017. We grew to over 800 people and raised over $250m in funding.

### 2013 Founder, Featurestream.io
I built a novel streaming, distributed random forest implementation on spark streaming and experimented with offering it as a hosted API service. I did a writeup about the [streaming random forest algorithm](https://medium.com/@andytwigg/featurestream-io-random-forests-6992b03b521) and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/featurestream/featurestream-client).

### 2009-12 CTO & cofounder, Acunu (acquired)
I was founder+CTO at Acunu, where we worked on new approaches to [write-optimized materialized views for big data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4282), and built a big data analytics system on top of Cassandra. Acquired by a large tech company.

### 2008-13 Oxford CS Department & Fellow, St. John's College, Oxford
Research interests: efficient algorithms for data mining via approximation, streaming, machine learning. Took a sabattical to found Acunu.
