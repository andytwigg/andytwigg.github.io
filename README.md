# about me

I'm a computer scientist with expertise in data processing and machine learning. I currently work on ML and large-scale data processing at Lacework, a cloud security company trying to use data to solve security challenges. We collect billions of messages per hour from machines and cloud logs, and use a variety of interesting techniques including inductive graph representation learning and anomaly detection.

Previously, I was founder/CTO of 2 acquired startups (Acunu, C9) and a Fellow in Computer Science at Oxford (St John's College). I received my PhD from Cambridge (2006) on approximate routing in graphs with failures.
